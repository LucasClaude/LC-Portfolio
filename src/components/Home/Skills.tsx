    I have worked on and lead several large scale projects for clients at my current employer Haneke Design.
    Having worked with Javascript since 2014, I was very excited to find a library/framework like React while in College
    and have really been passionate about how far React has come and all of the new additions that are constantly being added
    with each update.`,
